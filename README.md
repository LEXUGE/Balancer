Balancer is a side project I created while in high school.  I came up with this idea to solve chemical equations because I realized that in order to balance the equations, all we had to do was follow an alogorithm.  I developed this app to practice programming in Java, working with SWING and the user interface, and most importantly, help me finish my Chemistry homework!



## Example: Al+O<sub>2</sub> -->  Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><br />
